 🏡 Bangalore Home Price Prediction
This full-stack machine learning project predicts real estate prices in Bangalore using a dataset from Kaggle. It transforms raw housing data into actionable insights through data preprocessing, model training, API development, and a user-friendly web interface. The application is designed for real-world use, enabling buyers, analysts, and investors to obtain real-time home price estimates.

📊 Dataset
Source: Bengaluru House Price Data on Kaggle
Size: ~13,000 records
Features: Location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, price, and more

🧠 Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Handled missing values and standardized inconsistent entries.
Converted range-based square footage entries (e.g., "2100–2850") into numeric averages.
Extracted BHK from textual data and calculated price_per_sqft.
Aggregated rare locations into an "other" category to reduce dimensionality.
Filtered outliers, such as entries where the number of bathrooms exceeds the number of BHKs.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized data distributions and trends using histograms and scatter plots.
Identified and addressed skewed data and location-based price patterns.
Informed outlier removal and feature scaling decisions.

3. Model Building & Validation
Implemented Linear Regression as a baseline model.
Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features like location.
Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Evaluated models using K-Fold cross-validation with MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.

4. API Development
Serialized the trained model using pickle.
Developed a Flask API with endpoints:
/get_location_names: Retrieves available locations.
/predict_home_price: Returns price predictions based on user input.

5. Front-End Interface
Built a responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Enabled users to input area, BHK, bathrooms, and location.
Integrated the front-end with the Flask API to fetch and display predictions in real-time.

📈 Sample Prediction
To predict the price of a 2 BHK, 1000 sqft house with 2 bathrooms in "Whitefield":
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict_home_price \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"total_sqft": 1000, "location": "Whitefield", "bhk": 2, "bath": 2}'
Response:
{"estimated_price": 75.0}
